# Normal Font

A simple discord theme which returns the normal font.

I made this because I do not like the 'gg sans' font. Mostly because the W looks so scary!

## Install

Just download the [NormalFont.theme.css](NormalFont.theme.css) file and put it in your themes folder

Or you could download from the bd website...

## Usage

Enable the theme and you are ready to go!

No more scary W's...
